# Portfolio Building Workshop

## Inspiration

1. Start by looking at other people's portfolio. Click [Here](https://github.com/emmabostian/developer-portfolios).
1. Keep in mind that you are not trying to copy someone else's portfolio, but rather get inspiration from them.
1. Think about what you like and don't like about each portfolio you look at.
1. In this workshop, everyone will be building a similar portfolio, but you can always change it later.

## Setting Up Your GitHub Repository

1. Create a new repository on GitHub by clicking [here](https://github.com/new).
